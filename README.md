# react-native-nordic-thingy
This library is not usable yet. I've started development on it, but it's not high priority so it might take a bit.
Used to manage the BLE connection to Nordic THINGY devices. It subscribes to the many sensor notifications, parses the values and makes them available in a React hook.

## Installation

```sh
npm install react-native-nordic-thingy
```

## Usage


```js
import { multiply } from 'react-native-nordic-thingy';

// ...

const result = await multiply(3, 7);
```
